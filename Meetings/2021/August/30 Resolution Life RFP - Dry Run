        -   
    - Overwatch / Eagle
        - Internal project performed by Professional Services being 
            uplifted and reinforced by VMS
        - Started off as support so we could understand the solution, 
            but continued into a VMS build project
        - Project provides a large amount of value to the business
            but when handed over to VMS as logn term support, 
            more stable and hands-off processes/changes put into palce
        - Assistance from a Professional Services resource to
            provide more code work
        - Assistance with AWS 
            As I am a data engineer, but AWS knowledge is good, but not airtight
            Having other SME's allows me to ask them for help, as they do me
        - Learninh new technologies for the business and providing this knowledge to the business
            - Airflow
            - DBT

Culture
    - slack
    - open collaboration
    - information sharing
    - sharing the load
    - Can learn most technologies as we understand the similarities to current tech
        and can document the accentricies of each new solution for support/engineers
